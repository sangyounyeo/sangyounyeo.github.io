      <h2>Reflect on your experience of Core Learning during Foundations</h2>
      <div class="blogparagraph">

        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>I have learnt that I am more capable than I have previously thought, my ego affects me more than I would like and the importance of self reflection. Through research of neuroplasticity and growth mindset I have learnt that I am in control of my learning and that I can change to better myself as a programmer and as a student of life. I have also learnt that my ego has been a major factor in hold me back by prevent me from having a growth mindset. Both of the first two can be assisted by self reflection as it helps me come up with better plans and learn better by figuring out what I did wrong and well and also by keeping my ego in check.</p>

        <h2> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>The roles of values is that it guides and influence my decisions allowing me to make ethical choices, set goals that are meaningful to me therefor more likely to accomplish.<br> Empathy allows me to undestand the needs of others, whether it be clients, coworkers or teachers and helps me make effective communication, teamwork and solve problems.<br>
        Self-awareness helps me keep in check and allows me to realize my strengths, weaknessess make make effective plans and also allow constant improvement. I will be able to monitor my progress and adapt to my needs to imporove my learning.</p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>The amount of help that it has brought me. I have tried many things to make myself more productive but the core learning has taken me a step further in becoming a better learner and student.</p>
        
        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>I believe it is because it will allow students to cope with the intense workload (especially the full-time students) by giving them the necessary 'core' skills to adapt to this course and further along the line, in their careers.</p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>No it has definitely not been a waste of time. I believe I was able to learn as much programming I have to this point due to the core learning acting as a support system giving me the knowledge and self belief to accomplish what I have to this date.</p>
