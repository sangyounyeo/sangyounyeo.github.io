    <h2>Examine and identify who you are at this point.</h2>

    <section class="blogparagraph">
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
      <p>I faced many ethical dilemmas working in my prior job of being a floor layer. I began off as just an employee under my boss and knew that the company we contracted would expect us to bring back material if it was left over.<br><br>
         The ethical dilemma was that the company we contracted for had already charged the customers for the material and would not let them know there were left over materials to not refund them for unused material. At the same time my 
         boss would be getting paid more as it would count as laying more area of flooring. I had tried to tell my boss that I thought it was unethical and wrong, to convince him to stop complying but he said that this was apart of the trade and not to fuss about it. <br><br>
         As soon as I became my own contractor I would leave the extra material and let the customers know they had extras incase they needed some for repairs later on. I valued authenticity, honesty and my responsibility as a contractor to my customer over my financial gain immediately and over the long term through continued business with that company. The company eventually stopped giving me contracts for work after trying to convince me that there was nothing wrong with what they were doing since the customers didn’t know. I would do the same thing again because I value honesty and having inner peace knowing I did the right thing over monetary gain.

      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p>Born in Seoul, South Korea, raised in Auckland on the Central side bordering the West, I was influenced by two clashing cultures; East versus West. Belonging to both and yet somehow neither. <br><br>
        My family was a very traditional Korean immigrant family; both parents working all the time, struggling to make ends meet while my brother and I were looked after by my grandparents. Looking back now, having my grandparents around was great experience I am grateful for; it helped me grow my identity as a Korean, through them I was exposed to deeper aspects of the culture and being forced to speak the language to communicate with them has made me fluently bilingual. However in my youth, I was only able to see the glass half empty. Having them around meant that the values and the culture of my family was even more strict and old - even compared to the common Korean household. The strict hierarchal structure of family, the value of social status and success through education were a few of the things heavily enforced, values not held very high by my “Westie” peers. <br><br>
        These values of my family has never been an issue for me until college. Like most kids that age I was too young to comprehend the complexity of race and culture, and had just assumed that everyone was the same. The realisation came when I became friends with my now closest mates for over 13 years - a bunch of “Westies”. They were a rowdy bunch, ones who valued freedom, enjoying life and being true to oneself. The polar opposite of what I had been taught so far. It was liberating being exposed to such values and lifestyle, needless to say I was hooked. I spent my teenage years embracing the Westie life, living as they did, embracing the culture. It was a while before I realised that I wasn’t a Westie but at the same time I was not a “Korean” in the sense that my value and experiences were much different to the other Korean people I had and would met. <br><br>
        It wasn’t until I met my partner that came to terms with my biculturalism. She went through the same thing. Through her, I have merged both cultures to gain the best of both and acknowledged that I was a part of both in a unique blend of East and West. The culture of the East taught me the value of respecting others, education and to be a respectable member of society. The West taught me to embrace who I am, enjoy life and aim to be free of judgement. The East is my yang, the West my yin. It has formed my identity of who I am. I have pride and inner harmony about my values and identity. My experiences and the people around me gave me the advantages of being unique and adaptable to any environment.

      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      <p> My personal strengths are adaptability, willingness to learn, ability to work in teams and creativity. These are the traits I believe will help me develop through my journey as a programmer.<br><br> 
          I would have to say adaptability is one of my greatest strengths. Before realising programming was the career I want to commit to, I had many experiences in a variety of fields. In each of those fields, I fully adapted to the job as well as the work culture of the business I was working for. Although web development is a new area for me, I believe my adaptability will allow me to adapt and strive in the field.<br><br>

        My willingness to learn is definitely supportive of my learning journey. I believe that there are things to be learned from every experience in life. This strength of mine allows me to dig deeper and attempt to get a deeper working knowledge of what I am learning. It will support my learning as this strength keeps me curious and willing to take on extra roles so I can acquire more knowledge.<br><br>
        
        The experience of working in teams is always a pleasure. Getting the chance to meet new people and work alongside them is something I enjoy, as nothing like teamwork creates bonds. I know that there is a lot of teamwork required to be a developer and it is something I am looking forward to. <br><br>
        
        Creativity is a strength of mine which I take pride in. I always enjoy coming up with new ways to be more efficient and effective in my work. This I think will help me in my journey as a developer as it allows me to experiment with different ways of solving problems. Although it often ends up being incorrect, in the grand scheme of things my creativity has always allowed me to come up with more efficient and better ways of problem solving. This is something I am excited to have the opportunity to apply as in my previous jobs there were not much outlet creativity.<br><br>
        
        
        The combination of my strengths has always enabled me to rise from a total beginner to a managerial position in all of my work places so far. These strengths will help me through my learning journey as it will allow me to adapt to this new career path which I have no knowledge of, yet I am very excited to learn along side my cohort and creatively move forward from any problems life throws at me.
        </p>
        <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        <p> I believe the greatest factors that are going to limit my learning are overthinking and not being assertive enough. Through my experience in work and learning so far, I have realised that these traits have stunted my learning quite a bit. Although I am aware of them and am currently working on them I can see them limiting my learning and career development.<br><br>
          Overthinking is something I have to admit to have been a barrier in my self development. I have a tendency to overthink, somethings to the point where I over complicate simple solutions. This may show in my learning journey through not being able see the answer in front of me and routing for a complex solution instead.<br><br>
          Through my work experiences I have noticed that I need to be more assertive. There are times where I know the answer or a more efficient solution but I hold my self back from pushing for that solution. I struggle to tell colleagues or work superiors of these solutions and hence holding myself and the team back.<br><br>
          These are my limitations in the sense of learning and career development as a developer. Although I can see them holding me back, I am aware of my situation and am putting in conscious effort into making improvements through practice, revision and mindfulness. </p>

        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>When I was working as a restaurant manager tension and resistance was common thing.
          There was a head chef who would ignore every solution I gave. He was great at his job but had a tendency to communicate in a rude way and never took in others inputs to make work more efficient. It got to the point where staff began to quit and asked me to change shifts to avoid working with him.<br><br>
          He would consistently ignore any advice I gave him to smoothen the situation with our fellow workmates. I attempted a kind, empathetic approach acknowledging the difficulty of his position and when that didn’t improve the tension, I tried to be more assertive and let him know he has to learn to get along with the other workers. I had of course told the other colleagues that they also needed to try understand and acknowledged their frustrations too.<br><br>
          In the end nothing seemed to work and I had to reduce his hours so that I could minimise the overlapping hours between him and the employees.  Looking back I feel like I could have been more assertive and not overthought the problem because a lot of it was out of my control. My efforts were not the most effective but I tried everything within my power and minimised the tension. The chef began to respect the workers more after and would later resume to his full hours.</p>
