    <h2>Time to formulate your Learning Plan!</h2>
    <section class="blogparagraph">
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p> My long term goal is to pick up the learning habits and skills to continuosly develop my skills a developer. At this current moment I am not too sure of the specific career path I wish to take but I am enjoying the front end part whilst making my blog page so far. I wish to learn as much as I can so I am able to pick and choose the path that I am most passionate about when I graduate.</p>
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
      <p>I believe creativity and adaptability are my strengths when it comes to learning. I am really enjoying the blog page activity as it has a lot of room for creativity, it has helped me so far in making creative ways to solve problems and retain information. My adaptability allows me to adapt to the situation and what is required to bring the best out of me.</p>
      <p>Some limitations I think are going to hold me back are a lack of confidence and overthinking. I tend to overthink many things in life and study/work material is definitely one of them. There has been so many times I could not see the solution in front of me because I am over thinking about it so much! I am putting in effort to fix this by taking a small break to come see the task in a new light and it has been helping alot. My lack of confidence will get in the way of my learning as it holds me back from giving answers, asking questions and trying my different ways. Mindfulness and being concious of my self has been helping this alot, and putting in the effort to fix this has been actually building my confidence when it comes to a lot of things.</p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>The two skills I would like to develop most are time management and communication. Although I like working in teams, I always had a bit of struggle when it came to effective communication. My active listening isn't too bad but I struggle with being vocal about my opinions and much more with public speaking. Time management is another area I need to work on as it has been a cause of struggle for me in my past studying experiences.</p>
      <h3>How will you manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p>I will manage myself to work productively and ensure a safe collaborative environment with fellow learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives. I will prioritise effective communication, where I listen attentively and express my ideas clearly. I believe in treating others with respect and professionalism, creating a positive and inclusive atmosphere. I am working towards building strong time management skills, being committed to meeting deadlines and actively participating in discussions and projects. Embracing the flipped classroom model, I am open to continuous growth and contributing my opinions while remaining receptive to valuable feedback. Communication is the cornerstone of any successful collaboration. By actively engaging, adapting, and continuously improving, I aim to be an active part of an environment that values diverse perspectives and promotes progress for the cohort and myself. </p>
      <h3>What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h3>
      <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will take a step back, pause, and practice mindfulness. By focusing on the present moment and cultivating awareness of my thoughts and emotions, I will aim to get clarity and reduce stress. I may engage in deep breathing exercises or take short breaks to recharge and center myself before returning to the tasks at hand with renewed focus and resilience. If none of these seem to work I will clearly communicate my issues with team members and facilitators.</p>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>If I face an issue and I am unable to solve the problem for more than 15 minutes I will contact my facilitators and cohort members through the appropriate discord channel. I will create a thread with a clear title and explain exactly what the issue is and what I have tried to solve the issues. If applicable I will also upload a screenshot of my situation.</p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>My experience with the facilitation team has been great so far. Not much more I could expect from them. They encourage clear and open communication and have just generally been great. I would appreciate feedback and critism where it is needed once I hand my blog in!</p>
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
      <p>At the moment I am usually pretty free other than in the weekends, during 8am to 5:30pm when I am at work. Although for productivity reasons I have dumbed my phone down so I wont be reachable through discord or email unless I'm at my computer.</p>
