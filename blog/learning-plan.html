    <h2>Time to formulate your Learning Plan!</h2>
    <section class="blogparagraph">
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p> My long term goal is to pick up the learning habits and skills to continuosly develop my skills a developer. At this current moment I am not too sure of the specific career path I wish to take but I am enjoying the front end part whilst making my blog page so far. I wish to learn as much as I can so I am able to pick and choose the path that I am most passionate about when I graduate.</p>
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
      <p>I believe creativity and adaptability are my strengths when it comes to learning. I am really enjoying the blog page activity as it has a lot of room for creativity, it has helped me so far in making creative ways to solve problems and retain information. My adaptability allows me to adapt to the situation and what is required to bring the best out of me.</p>
      <p>Some limitations I think are going to hold me back are a lack of confidence and overthinking. I tend to overthink many things in life and study/work material is definitely one of them. There has been so many times I could not see the solution in front of me because I am over thinking about it so much! I am putting in effort to fix this by taking a small break to come see the task in a new light and it has been helping alot. My lack of confidence will get in the way of my learning as it holds me back from giving answers, asking questions and trying my different ways. Mindfulness and being concious of my self has been helping this alot, and putting in the effort to fix this has been actually building my confidence when it comes to a lot of things.</p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>The two skills I would like to develop most are time management and communication. Although I like working in teams, I always had a bit of struggle when it came to effective communication. My active listening isn't too bad but I struggle with being vocal about my opinions and much more with public speaking. Time management is another area I need to work on as it has been a cause of struggle for me in my past studying experiences.</p>
      <h3>How will you manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p>I will manage myself to work productively and ensure a safe collaborative environment with fellow learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives. I will prioritise effective communication, where I listen attentively and express my ideas clearly. I believe in treating others with respect and professionalism, creating a positive and inclusive atmosphere. I am working towards building strong time management skills, being committed to meeting deadlines and actively participating in discussions and projects. Embracing the flipped classroom model, I am open to continuous growth and contributing my opinions while remaining receptive to valuable feedback. Communication is the cornerstone of any successful collaboration. By actively engaging, adapting, and continuously improving, I aim to be an active part of an environment that values diverse perspectives and promotes progress for the cohort and myself. </p>
      <h3>What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h3>
      <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will take a step back, pause, and practice mindfulness. By focusing on the present moment and cultivating awareness of my thoughts and emotions, I will aim to get clarity and reduce stress. I may engage in deep breathing exercises or take short breaks to recharge and center myself before returning to the tasks at hand with renewed focus and resilience. If none of these seem to work I will clearly communicate my issues with team members and facilitators.</p>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>If I face an issue and I am unable to solve the problem for more than 15 minutes I will contact my facilitators and cohort members through the appropriate discord channel. I will create a thread with a clear title and explain exactly what the issue is and what I have tried to solve the issues. If applicable I will also upload a screenshot of my situation.</p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>My experience with the facilitation team has been great so far. Not much more I could expect from them. They encourage clear and open communication and have just generally been great. I would appreciate feedback and critism where it is needed once I hand my blog in!</p>
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
      <p>At the moment I am usually pretty free other than in the weekends, during 8am to 5:30pm when I am at work. Although for productivity reasons I have dumbed my phone down so I wont be reachable through discord or email unless I'm at my computer.</p>

    <h2>Learning Plan Part 2 - Bootcamp</h2>
    <div class="blogparagraph">
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>I am hoping to use the skills I gain during this course to begin a career as a programmer. I wish to make a positive impact in whichever career path I choose and also to secure a stable income to support my partner and whanau. Although I don't have a specific destination in mind at the moment, my goal is to get into full-time employment as soon as possible. With the right opportunities and continuous learning, I hope to create a successful and fulfilling career for myself.</p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>Looking back on my strengths and weaknesses from the foundations phase, I think that they will continue during Bootcamp. One of my strengths is my dedication and willingness to work hard. I am determined to improve and have thankfully been seeing progress. However,  there is always room for improvement. I am committed to pushing myself further and continuously growing as a programmer.</p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>One of the challenges I anticipate facing during Bootcamp is time management and assertiveness. I have noticed moments when I could have been more assertive and contributed to group discussions. I aim to overcome this by being more vocal about my ideas and opinions, effectively communicating with my team members, and ensuring that I play an active role in collaborative tasks. Additionally, managing my time effectively and prioritizing tasks will be crucial to meet deadlines and maintain a balanced work-life schedule.</p>
      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>Two areas I am particularly focused on are assertiveness and confidence. Building confidence will help me overcome any self-doubt and hesitation, allowing me to take on challenges with a positive mindset and perform at my best.</p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>The Foundation Team has been great! I expect the team to continue providing feedback and constructive criticism!</p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>During Bootcamp, I will hold myself accountable to a higher level of commitment. I am determined not to let down my cohort mates, whanau, and my partner. To achieve this, I will work harder, focusing on productivity and efficiency. I will schedule my week, ensuring that I have a well-structured plan in place, and effectively communicate it with others. By practicing mindfulness and active listening, I aim to build strong relationships with my peers and create a supportive and collaborative atmosphere. I am looking forward to working with everyone!</p>
