      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <div class="blogparagraph">
        <h3>There was a time I was blocked on a simple problem...</h3>
        <p>When I was attempting the Java Kata I got stuck on the FizzBuzz. I had used pseudocode, console.log and reading the error message and googling to fix come to a point where I thought I should have solved the problem and the function should work as it needed to. However, I didn’t initially define the output. This lead to the console.log showing undefinedFizzBuzz. At this point I as I tried most of the other problem solving techniques, I tried the rubber ducky method. I felt silly as I was saying it not only because I looked like a mad man taking to the wall but because I soon realised that the answer was staring at me: “undefined”. I learned that I should take a second to actually process what’s in front of me and talk it through instead of just running my brain and that you have to define and empty string.</p>

        <h3>But then I elegantly solved a problem..</h3>
        <p>The problem was the next Kata I was to solve. Super FizzBuzz. This time as it was straight after the FizzBuzz shenanigan, I really took a moment to break down the problem into small pieces. Talking to the wall again figuring out exactly what I need to do. I tried what I assumed would be the solution, console.logged it and it came with no error messages. I felt like I had redeemed myself and felt quite good. Then I remembered that on a previous task in the sprint I studied .map(), a JS method which pretty much does the same thing as the solution I came up with. I attempted to use the .map() method and it came out to be much cleaner and more efficient. I learned that really processing the information and taking the time makes it much better and that mapping can be used as an alternative to for loops to provide a much shorter and cleaner code.</p>
        
        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>

        <p><strong>Pseudocode: </strong>I am moderately confident in using pseudocode. With practice I feel like I won’t have too many issues with it.</p>
        <p><strong>Trying something: </strong>This method is my go to at the moment. I am the most comfortable with it but I am aiming to try to use the other techniques much more</p>
        <p><strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>I am beginning to be more confident in using this as it has been helping me quite a bit when I am stuck.</p>
        <p><strong>Reading error messages: </strong>With the help of Google and chatGPT, I feel like I can somewhat process the error going on but I am hoping to learn more so that I understand.</p>
        <p><strong>Console.logging: </strong>I feel quite confident with console.log, it helps to be able to see how the function is acting differently to what I expected it to.</p>
        <p><strong>Googling:</strong> Goes hand in hand with trying something. Again something I probably rely on too much and should attempt to use other processes more as I know they have more to offer on a lot of things.</p>
        <p><strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>Not very confident in this one to be completely honest. I am quite awful at spoken words and tend to feel like I can’t quite word what I mean. It’s a weakness I am working on at the moment.</p>
        <p><strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>This one is also similar to asking peers, I’m not the best at forging words in my head and saying it out in a coherent sentence and tend to feel like I’m wasting peoples time.</p>
        <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>I’ve got a bit of a mixed level of confidence in this aspect as I feel like I reflect decently but seem to fail upon acting on it.</p>

        <h3>The Unfortunate Time I Was Reluctant To Ask For Help</h3>
        <p>This happens a lot more than it should, as I tend to prefer solving a problem on my own. The time I think it was the worst was when I was doing the index page of the blogs. I had a lot of issues which looking back I really should have asked the coached and peers to help because I just ended up doing things in a very long and difficult way. I feel like I was reluctant due to a mix of things including my ego, not wanting to hassle people and also fear of not being able to understand the solution and wasting peoples time. Now that I’ve reflected on this I feel that it was stupid of me to not ask, as I missed out on learning and an opportunity to get to know everyone better or just say hi. So from next time I think I’ll just suck it up and ask for the help that I definitely needed.
